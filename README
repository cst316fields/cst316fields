============
---------------------

what's up:  we are going to install visual studio 2013   (if you can't install what versiion you can)

each of us will work on learning a piece of visual studio -- how to code your piece -- 
  
   -- so you will be responsible for knowing how to code your piece next tues.

   --  we will group code the project on one laptop -- then put the result in github

  -- no forking around - we should be near finished by the end of next class

  -- you need to figure out how to code according to the 'story' which I will detail below

ALSO DECIDED: we are using sql server as database

-------------------------

Rick:  the C# code -- for the controller   ie. what happens when buttons get pushed

Logan:  html and how to format a page -- you work on the right side of the page --with the field info and reservation form

Keith/Chris :  data base & services - know how to code the tables on tues  -- both of you also lookup and learn   gridview control - we may use them

Nolan:  the asp gui controls and how to format them on the page -- you work on the left side of the page -- the buttons for fields, reservation, and cancel

note: we could also use WPF - but may be better off NOT doing it for lab5 due to time constraints

--------------------------

USE CASE: (and info on how web app will look and operate)

we have a parks & rec website -- its function is to rent out playing fields

user -- wants to rent out a soccer field on a specific day


home page has a menu on the left: 



user pushes button that says 'fields' -- button has code behind that gets fields info from database and displays the following on the screen to the right:

field #             type          date1  date2   date3   date4   

example

1                       soccer         u         r            u           r


user pushes button 'schedule' on the left -- brings up a gui form on the right (next to the fields info) -- shows the info:

field #   __________

date      ---------------

name     ---------------


user then pushes a 'save' button on this form -- code behind the save -- sends data back to database

field info display updated:  an 'r' gets placed in the slot that was reserved

-------------------------------------------------------------

alternate use case:  user wants to cancel -- there is a 'cancel' button on the left -- user presses cancel

   -- lets work on that if/after we get the rest working 

-------------------------------------------------------------

database schema -- lets start out making it easy -- then add more advanced date types and user info IF WE HAVE TIME

table:  Field

attributes:  field#   int,       field type     string, 


table:  Person

attributes:   name  string


table:  Reservation

attributes:  field#  int,     name string,   date  string   -- as in date1  date2   date3   etc.


--------------------------------------------------------------

note on my end: if I don't get my version up to date, I will just code on my version (2008) and transfer my code in one way or another       


2nd note: this does not seem like much, but there is a learning curve

  -- hard parts -- lining up gui controls, connecting to database and queries,  displaying data on the screen
